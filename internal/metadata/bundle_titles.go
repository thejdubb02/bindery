// Bundle-title detection, split into two confidence tiers.
//
// These patterns were ported from the interim external workaround
// (denoise_author.py) in #1968 after being confirmed empirically, over
// several authors, against real OpenLibrary titles. They are a title-text
// heuristic rather than a work-type field because OpenLibrary does not
// reliably distinguish a "bundle" work from a regular one anywhere in its
// API response: a box set arrives as an ordinary Work, passes every other
// filter (non-empty title, language set, media type matches) and lands in
// the wanted list indistinguishable from a real book.
//
// The tiers exist because those patterns do not all carry the same risk
// (#1780). The unambiguous ones name a physical bundle in words no
// single-book title uses for anything else, so they run on every catalogue
// ingestion regardless of settings. The ambiguous ones have documented
// real-world false positives, so they stay behind the opt-in SkipPartBooks
// metadata-profile setting where their risk was accepted deliberately.
//
// "trilogy" is deliberately in neither tier: far too many real single books
// are subtitled "Book One of the X Trilogy".

// unambiguousBundleTitleRe matches the tier that runs unconditionally. Every
// branch names a multi-volume product explicitly ("box set", "3 Books Set",
// "Carton of 10 Signed Copies"); none of them is phrasing a real single book
// uses to describe itself.

	// In"), which the parenthesized form this was ported from never does.

// ambiguousBundleTitleRe matches the tier that stays behind SkipPartBooks.
// Each branch has a known false-positive shape, recorded below, which is why
// switching it on is left to the user rather than applied to everyone.
//
// The two slash branches require actual whitespace around every "/" ("\s+"
// either side, not "\s*"). Real anthology naming is always spaced ("Title A
// / Title B"); an unspaced slash is far more often a title using "/" as its
// own punctuation (a two-character-choice title like "He/She/It", or
// "Rock/Paper/Scissors") than a bundle. Confirmed against real
// maintainer-reported false positives (vavallee, PR #1968 review).
//
// Even spaced and with 3+ segments the shape is not conclusive: a genuine
// single-volume edition bundling several distinct classic works looks
// identical, e.g. the Penguin Nietzsche edition "The Anti-Christ / Ecce Homo
// / Twilight of the Idols".

// "Omnibus" as its own proper-noun title ("The Omnibus of Crime", a genuine

//
// Known residual gap, and the reason a bare "omnibus" stays in the ambiguous
// tier: this assumes real non-bundle usage always leads and real
// bundle-descriptor usage always trails. Two real books break that. "The New
// Turing Omnibus" and "Thrown under the omnibus" both use "omnibus"
// metaphorically/idiomatically in a trailing position, so they are still
// wrongly caught. The real distinguishing signal (does this book actually
// bundle other separately-catalogued works) is not recoverable from title
// text alone for a bare keyword the way it is for the slash-joined case
// (pruneAuthorWorkRedundantTitles can check named segments against known
